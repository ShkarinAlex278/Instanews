# Personal learnings:
The Instanews project was useful for me because it self covered varieties of tasks such as: 
* Work with different files in one program.
* Using JQuery as library of JavaScript.
* Got access by JSON to New York Time resource.
* Created file Gulp which is a task runner built on Node.js and npm, 
used for automation of time-consuming and repetitive tasks involved in 
web development like minification, concatenation, cache busting, unit testing, linting, optimization and etc.
* Applied a new method in css image processing using Grid.
